//	<path>.geul       the document's bytes (application/vnd.geul)
//	<path>            its viewer page (text/html; the host picks by Accept)
//	<dir>/index.html  the directory listing
//	<dir>/index.json  the listing for the tree browser
//	_static/          the graph scripts
//
// The pages are the ones serve answers. The codec specs come from the tree;
// a tree whose specs do not read lays records out generically, as serve does.
// A document that does not decode stops the build. dst must not be src or
// inside it.
