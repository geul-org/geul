//ff:what WrapDocument — prefix HEAD+BODY+END words with the narrowest DOC-* record carrying the total length
package core

// WrapDocument opens inner (the HEAD Meta records, BODY, the body records and
// END) with a DOC-1WORD/2WORD/4WORD record whose payload is the document's total
// word count from the DOC record through END (GEUL t002 OVERVIEW 구조). The
// narrowest width that holds the total is used, as the canonical form requires;
// the DOC record's own 2/3/5 words count toward the total. A DOC record is at
// most 5 words, so encoding it cannot fail.
