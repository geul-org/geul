package pack

// streamState is the part of a Stream that a checkpoint saves (gob). Objects
// are reserved in start order; an open one has Size 0 until it closes. Data
// and Index are the open data pack and index object (Num -1: none) with the
// bytes written so far (Off, Count). Inv and Paths are the open data pack's
// inventory. Dict and DictRaw are the dictionary records use. PHeads are the
// first key and location of each written P leaf, PLeaf the entries of the
// leaf being filled. Runs are the spilled sorted H runs (RunCount names the
// next). Named are the named records written. Last is the last P key put and
// Count how many P records there are. Meta is the caller's own progress,
// saved with the same checkpoint (Checkpoint, Stream.Meta).
