//ff:what Stream — a pack set written in one pass from records fed in key order, with bounded memory and checkpoints
package pack

import "os"

// Stream writes the first generation of a pack set from P records fed in
// ascending key order (Put) and a few named records (PutNamed), for archives
// too big to stage as a directory tree (geul-dev files/pack/README.md §6,
// "대량 쓰기"). Data packs are cut at PackSize as records arrive; P leaf
// blocks are written as soon as they fill (keys arrive sorted); H keys, which
// arrive in random order, are spilled to sorted run files and merged when
// the stream closes. Memory therefore holds one P leaf, one H run, one data
// pack's inventory and the first keys of the written blocks, not the records.
// Checkpoint saves everything needed to go on (ResumeStream) after a crash;
// the bytes written do not depend on when checkpoints happen.
