// Zstd compresses with klauspost/compress. Level is a zstd level 1–22 (0 is
// DefaultZstdLevel); the library maps it to its four speeds (1–2 fastest,
// 3–6 default, 7–10 better, 11+ best). DictSize is the size of a dictionary
// trained for a set that has none (0 is DefaultDictSize); below 0 new records
// use no dictionary. Workers is how many records a writer compresses at once
// (0 is DefaultWorkers; each best-level encoder holds tens of MiB). Use it as
// *Zstd; it is safe for concurrent use.
